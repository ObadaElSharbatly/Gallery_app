## Use locally

first you need to run `npm i` to let tailwindCss works fine
then you need to run this command in terminal for compiling tailwindCss classes

```
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/style/index.css -o ./public/style.css --watch
```

when you create a new css file in `./src/style` you need to import it in `index.css`
